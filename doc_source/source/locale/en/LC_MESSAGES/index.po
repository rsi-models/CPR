"The Canadians' Preparation for Retirement (CPR) tool was developed by a "
"team at HEC Montréal's `Retirement and Savings Institute (RSI) "
"<https://ire.hec.ca>`_, with financial support from the National Pension "
"Hub at the `Global Risk Institute (GRI) "
"<https://globalriskinstitute.org>`_. It allows to compute retirement "
"preparation for any household or group of households for which the user "
"has the required input (personal and financial information) at any given "
"point in time. It has been used with 2018 proprietary data to prepare `a "
"report published by in June 2020 <https://ire.hec.ca/en/canadians-"
"preparation-retirement-cpr/>`_."

"The CPR simulates the years between the base year and retirement, then "
"converts all financial wealth into actuarially fair annuities upon "
"retirement and compares post- and pre-retirement situations. Compared to "
"other available tools, the CPR offers complete flexibility and "
"transparency, in that its code is fully and freely available online and "
"it can be modified and adapted at will. Importantly and distinctively, "
"the CPR also allows to perform stochastic simulations, letting several "
"dimensions vary over time according to cutting-edge processes and "
"assumptions. All those can be modified by the sophisticated user, as can "
"the number of replications that the tool uses to average outcomes and "
"determine retirement preparation (or the probability thereof). The "
"current version of the CPR takes 2018 as base year and the tax systems of"
" Quebec and Ontario are currently modelled (other provinces can be "
"approximated using one of these 2 provinces, preferably Ontario)."

"The CPR outputs a level of “consumption replacement” for each household "
"that passes through the simulator and classifies each household as "
"“prepared” or “unprepared”, according to the pre-set criterion. As in "
"reports published by other groups in the 2010s, retirement preparation "
"can be assessed by computing the ratio of post-retirement consumption to "
"pre-retirement consumption and comparing it to a cutoff set at 65% for "
"the top 4 income quintiles, and at 80% for the bottom income quintile. "
"These measures can then be aggregated over all households analyzed to "
"obtain a) the average of the replacement rate, or its distribution; and "
"b) the proportion of households that are deemed “prepared”. When using "
"the stochastic version of the tool, preparation probabilities can also be"
" computed and visualized, for one or several households. The figure below"
"  illustrates conceptually the parts and flows of the CPR."

"The CPR and the other tools it uses (SRD and SRPP) are written in Python,"
" a modern, simple and fast language. In order to use it, it is essential "
"to ensure first that an up-to-date Python distribution is installed, for "
"example using Anaconda. Although not essential, it will also be useful to"
" have a minimal understanding of Python environments and, if possible, "
"vocabulary (e.g. function, class, instance, profile)."
