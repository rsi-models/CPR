"The CPR and the other tools it uses (SRD and SRPP) are written in Python,"
" a modern, simple and fast language. In order to use it, it is essential "
"to ensure first that an up-to-date Python distribution is installed, for "
"example using Anaconda. In all cases, the minimum requirements to use the"
" CPR are Python 3.6+ with *numpy*, *pandas* and *xlrd*. Although not "
"essential, it will also be useful to have a minimal understanding of "
"Python environments and, if possible, vocabulary (e.g. function, class, "
"instance, profile)."

"The CPR uses two other packages that are produced by the RSI and the "
"Research Chair on Intergenerational Economics (CREEi), which is supported"
" by the RSI: the Disposable Income Simulator (`Simulateur de revenu "
"disponible, or SRD <https://creei-models.github.io/srd/>`_; documentation"
" in French), which computes taxes and major benefits; and the Public "
"Pension Plans Simulator (`Simulateur de régimes de pensions publiques, or"
" SRPP <https://creei-models.github.io/srpp/>`_; documentation in French),"
" which simulates QPP and CPP contributions and benefits. Both the SRD and"
" the SRPP are automatically installed along with the CPR."

"If one is unable to install the CPR, a zip file containing CPR and its "
"dependencies, SRD and SRPP, can be downloaded from `Github "
"<https://github.com/rsi-models/CPR/releases>`_ (choose the file "
"CPR_with_dep.zip in the latest release). To start using  the CPR, it "
"suffices to unzip the file in the directory of your choice and either "
"work from that directory or add the directory to the path (for example by"
" using the module *sys*). A jupyter notebook explaining how CPR works, "
"*Tutorial CPR*, is also included in the zip file. If one does not want "
"the CPR anymore, the *cpr*, *srd* and *srpp* folders can simply be "
"deleted."
