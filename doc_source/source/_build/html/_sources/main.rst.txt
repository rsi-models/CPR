This module calls the simulator.

.. currentmodule:: CPR.main

The function *run_simulations* runs the simulations. Its arguments are used to select whether the stochastic version of the tool is to be used, as well as the number of simulations (replications) that should be carried out. Any parameter value can also be changed here, to use values other than the default ones provided.

.. autofunction:: run_simulations
