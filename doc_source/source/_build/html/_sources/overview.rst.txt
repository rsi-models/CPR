Installing the CPR
==================

The CPR can be easily installed using pip::

  pip install cpr

The CPR uses two other packages that are produced by the Research Chair on Intergenerational Economics (CREEi), which is supported by the RSI: the Disposable Income Simulator (`Simulateur de revenu disponible, or SRD <https://creei-models.github.io/srd/>`_; documentation in French), which computes taxes and major benefits; and the Public Pensions Income Simulator (Simulateur de revenu de pensions publiques, or SRPP), which simulates QPP and CPP benefits. Both the SRD and the SRPP are automatically installed along with the CPR.

In a notebook or a project, the CPR is called on by adding the following command:

.. code:: ipython3

    import cpr

To uninstall the CPR, the SRD and the SRPP, pip can be used::

  pip uninstall cpr srd srpp

If using pip is not possible:

1. Go to `pypi.org <https://www.pypi.org>`_ and download the CPR, SRD and SRPP source files (.tar.gz extension)

2. Extract the .tar.gz files. In Windows, open the files using 7-zip or Winzip, or enter in a command window (replacing addresses and file names)::

    tar -xvzf C:\\PATH_TO_FILE\\FILE.tar.gz -C C:\\PATH_TO_EXTRACTION_FOLDER

3. In the folders just extracted, *cpr-x.x.x*, *srd-x.x.x* and *srpp-x.x.x* (*x.x.x* being the version number), the folders *cpr*, *srd* and *srpp* can be found

4. Place *cpr*, *srd* and *srpp* in the folder of your choice

To call the CPR, its address must be added:

.. code:: ipython3

    import sys
    sys.path.append("C:\PATH_TO_FOLDER_CONTAINING_CPR_SRD_AND_SRPP")

    import cpr

If one does not want the CPR, the *cpr*, *srd* and *srpp* folders can simply be deleted.

For more details on how to use the CPR, a :ref:`tutorial` is available.
